          Days seem sometimes as if they'll never end<br />
          Sun digs its heels to taunt you<br />
          But after sunlit days, one thing stays the same<br />
          Rises the moon<br />
          <br />
          Days fade into a watercolour blur<br />
          Memories swim and haunt you<br />
          But look into the lake, shimmering like smoke<br />
          Rises the moon<br />
          <br />
          Oh-oh, close your weary eyes<br />
          I promise you that soon the autumn comes<br />
          To darken fading summer skies<br />
          Breathe, breathe, breathe<br />
          <br />
          Days pull you down just like a sinking ship<br />
          Floating is getting harder<br />
          But tread the water, child, and know that meanwhile<br />
          Rises the moon<br />
          <br />
          Days pull you up just like a daffodil<br />
          Uprooted from its garden<br />
          They'll tell you what you owe, but know even so<br />
          Rises the moon<br />
          <br />
          You'll be visited by sleep<br />
          I promise you that soon the autumn comes<br />
          To steal away each dream you keep<br />
          Breathe, breathe, breathe

          Hand in hand<br />
          The flowers understand<br />
          That we're fine, you and I<br />
          <br />
          Hands are tied<br />
          I don't mind<br />
          I'll make you be ok<br />
          <br />
          But recently<br />
          Everyone says they are seeing less of me<br />
          I could do better if I had energy<br />
          Be like I used to be<br />
          <br />
          But frequently<br />
          I picture myself walking straight into the sea<br />
          Laughing as the waves come rolling to my knees<br />
          What a place to be<br />
          <br />
          Side by side<br />
          You keep me safe from their static getting through<br />
          Please be fine<br />
          It's too late now to go leave you behind<br />

          What a place to be<br />
          <br />
          And it's a lovely day for swimming<br />
          Pretend I didn't see the red flags that said don't go<br />
          Cause if a storm out there's beginning<br />
          I'll find it for myself and not cause someone told me so<br />

          Perhaps you've not known before<br />
          To need someone and not be needed anymore<br />
          I know nobody's to blame<br />
          My tongue's still papercut speaking your name<br />
          <br />
          Perhaps you don't understand<br />
          When I want you to care but now my worlds in your hands<br />
          What am I supposed to do<br />
          Pretend I'm happy for you?<br />
          <br />
          Waited all day to cry<br />
          Now I'm here my eyes are dry<br />
          Couldn't help you in the end<br />
          Don't know what I was looking to mend<br />
          <br />
          Perhaps you've not sung a song<br />
          Of seeing yourself to every way come up wrong<br />
          The world cant hurt me no more<br />
          When I'm the very best at making myself sore
